# gamlss.dist: Distributions for Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape

A set of distributions which can be used for modelling the response variables in Generalized
Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape introduced by
[Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9876.2005.00510.x).
The distributions can be continuous, discrete, or mixed distributions. Extra distributions
can be created, by transforming, any continuous distribution defined on the real line, to a
distribution defined on ranges 0 to infinity or 0 to 1, by using a 'log' or a 'logit'
transformation, respectively.
